# Alexander Carcamo's Repository 
Hello, my name is Alexander Carcamo and welcome to my repository! I am a graduate from the University of Maryland (UMD) with a bachelors of science in Information Science. I am an avid sports fanatic with skills in the sports analytics field. Here you will find multiple projects that I have completed while studying at the UMD. As you can see, I tried to complete most projects with a sports-releted objective. Thank you for taking the time to look through my repository.
