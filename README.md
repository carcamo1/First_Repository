# Alexander Carcamo's Repository 
Hello my name is Alexander Carcamo and welcome to my repository. I am a graduate from the University of Marlyand with a degree in Information Science.
I am a fan of all different types of sports and wish to use my skills in the sports analytics field. 
Here you will find multiple projects that I have completed while studying at the University of Maryland. As you can see I tried to complete most projects with some sort of sports objective.
